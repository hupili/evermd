# github-markdown

This module is downloaded from:
[http://rubygems.org/gems/github-markdown](http://rubygems.org/gems/github-markdown)

I had a hard time installing as a gem try to run it. 
After inspecting the directory tree, I think I can 
hard quote the entire project here. 

## Deploy

To deploy, run:
```
bash deploy.sh
```
