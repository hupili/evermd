# evermd Test Suite

## Basic of MD

### Line Wrap

The following dots are on separate lines in source:
.
.
.
.
.
.
However, in the output, they should be on a single line. 

### Code

Code embedding: input() of evermd.pl

```
sub input {
	my @tmp ;
	if (! defined($fn_input) || $fn_input eq "-" ){
		@tmp = <STDIN> ;	
	} else {
		open f_input, "<$fn_input" or die("no such file: $fn_input\n") ;
		@tmp = <f_input> ;
	}
	return @tmp ;
}
```

Inline code test. 
You can use `evermd {doc}` command to convert an 
evermd compliant document into HTML.

### List

evermd does support ordered list but it is not recommended. 
There may be some rendering problems due to 
the integration of different tools. 

The general guideline:

   * Use unordered list by convention. 
   * Leave a blank line before and after each list.

### Table

General info of evermd:

{evermd:table:begin}
---
& Author & HU, Pili
& Start Time & Aug, 2012
& Repo & https://github.com/hupili/evermd
{evermd:table:end}

A more weird table:
{evermd:table:begin}
---
& - & - & -
&& - & -  
& - && -
{evermd:table:end}

You see, it every easy to construct tables 
with columns spanning multiple cells. 

### Attribute 

Let's center the table shown in previous sections
and color it red:

{evermd:attribute:begin}
style
text-align: center; color: #ff0000;
{evermd:attribute:end}

{evermd:table:begin}
---
& Author & HU, Pili
& Start Time & Aug, 2012
& Repo & https://github.com/hupili/evermd
{evermd:table:end}

### Comment

You should see nothing between "a" and "b". 

a

{evermd:comment:begin}
This is the comment, you shouldn't see it. 
{evermd:comment:end}

b

### Var

This document is last built at:
{evermd:var:begin}
now
{evermd:var:end}


{evermd:var:begin}
evermd
{evermd:var:end}
