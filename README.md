Ever MarkDown! Solution Stacks for Markdown Usage

Introduction
----

MarkDown is an elegant language to structure a passage. 
One you use several times, you'll never forget the 
concise way of formatting. 
You focus more on the semantic party rather than 
the appearance. 

You may also noticed that MarkDown looks like
the younger brother of MarkUp. 
That's true. 
It's younger but more powerful. 
It's not so mature, so there are some 
caveats in writing or compiling. 

This repo collects Markdown related issues and solutions. 
Of course, the configurations are for my own flavour. 

How to Use
----

This project mainly contains some articles 
to help you better experience MarkDown. 
Just click into different directories and read them. 

To get all the files in this project, 

	git clone https://github.com/hupili/evermd.git
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
